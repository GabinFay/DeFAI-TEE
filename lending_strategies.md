## Strategy Recommendations

### For Beginners
Start with a majority allocation (70-80%) in low-risk pools like USDT-USDC.e, with a small portion (20-30%) in medium-risk pools like sFLR-WFLR to learn about the ecosystem while minimizing risk.

### For Experienced DeFi Users
Consider a balanced portfolio with 40% in low-risk, 40% in medium-risk, and 20% in high-risk pools to optimize returns while managing volatility.

### For Risk-Tolerant Investors
Allocate 50-60% to high-APY options like sFLR-flrETH and WFLR-USDC.e, with the remainder in medium-risk pools as a hedge against volatility.

## Important Considerations

1. **Impermanent Loss**: Higher volatility pairs typically experience greater impermanent loss
2. **Liquidity Risks**: Lower liquidity pools may have higher slippage when entering/exiting positions
3. **APY Fluctuations**: Returns can vary significantly based on trading volume and market conditions
4. **Gas Fees**: Consider transaction costs when entering smaller positions
5. **Market Correlation**: Diversify across different asset types to reduce overall portfolio risk
